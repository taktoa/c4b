C4B SOURCE CODE
---------------

This is the source code of our tool.

- CODE -

If you really want to do so, you can
read Logic.ml and Hood.ml, the first
module contains handling of logical
contexts (\Gamma in the paper), while
the second does contraint generation
on the quantitative contexts (Q in
the paper).

- TESTS -

While we developped the tool, we wrote
some tests.  They turned out very
useful to test regression.  They are
written in a minimal imperative
programming language whose grammar is
described in Grammar.mly.

We encourage you to read the tests in
the t/ directory.

You can run the test whole suite using
the command:

    sh t/run.sh

It should make sure that the bounds of
all the small programs are correct (the
expected answers are stored in t/q/).
